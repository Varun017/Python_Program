1. Gesture Recognition using Neural Network | Tech Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook | Jan '20
Objective -> Developed a Neural Network Model for video Analysis using CNN with considerable accuracy, which analysis few  hundred of gesture from the dataset and classifies into five different hand gesture which shall then be used in Smart Television as a feature for controlling the Smart TV with the help of Hand gesture such as Volume Up, Volume Down, Fast Forward and Reverse

2. Building Chabot with RASA | Tech Stack: Python | Nov '18
Objective -> Built a Domain Specific Chabot eg: Restaurant Chabot using Open Source Framework such as Rasa and         deployed it on Public Channel such as Slack

3. Predicting Price of a Car using Linear Regression Model | Tech Stack: Python | Nov '18
Objective -> The aim of the model is to predict the Price of Car with the available Independent variable. Which in turn is used by the Management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the Independent Variable. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars ,the business strategy etc.to meet certain price levels. Further,the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market
